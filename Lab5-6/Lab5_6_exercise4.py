"""Exercise 4 - GPT-2 fine-tuning and generation
Using the Hugging Face library transformers4
, fine-tune a generalized GPT2-model to generate sentences
based on all chapters of Chamber of Secrets except chapter 1. Then generate sentences based on the first
few words in the original sentences of chapter 1. Explain your results.
There are a lot of resources on the topic here. Use this an opportunity to learn something cool and
avoid copy-pasting directly.
